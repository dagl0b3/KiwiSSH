# About KiwiSSH <!-- omit from toc -->

KiwiSSH is a network device configuration backup tool that connects to your devices via SSH/Telnet, fetches their configurations, and stores them in git repositories for easy version control and change tracking. It also provides a user-friendly web interface to manage your devices, view backup logs, and see configuration changes over time.

It was created as better alternative to RANCID and Oxidized, with a focus on simplicity, ease of use, and modern technologies.

> [!WARNING]
> KiwiSSH is still in development and may contain bugs and support for only a limited number of vendors. If you want to collaborate, contribute or just have questions, please open an issue or PR.

# Installation

## Bare Metal

To run KiwiSSH on your local machine without Docker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the backend directory and install the required Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. Set up the `kiwissh.yaml` configuration file in the `config/` directory
4. Run the backend using `python entrypoint.py`
5. Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies with `npm install`
6. Start the frontend with `npm run dev`

## Docker

KiwiSSH uses separate Docker images for backend and frontend.

- Backend: FastAPI API service
- Frontend: Nginx serving the built Vue app and proxying `/api/*` to backend

1. Update the [`docker-compose.yaml.example`](docker-compose.yaml.example) with the correct image tags for backend and frontend and set your desired environment variables (optional) and volume mounts. You can find an overview of all available environment variables [here in the README](#environment-variables) or [in the example .env file](backend/.env.example).
2. Run the [`docker-compose.yaml.example`](docker-compose.yaml.example) file
3. Open the UI at `http://<IP>:8123`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using SSH key authentication (remote git push, device backup auth, or jumphost auth), mount your SSH material into `/home/kiwissh/.ssh` and ensure permissions are correct (typically `600` for private keys/config/known_hosts, owned by `kiwissh` uid:gid 1000:1000).

> [!NOTE]
> - API calls are available through the frontend proxy: `http://<IP>:8123/api/v1/...`
> - The backend image includes default `ssh_profiles.yaml` and `vendors/*.yaml` directly in `/config`
> - The backend always reads configuration from `/config`
> - You still need a valid `kiwissh.yaml` in `/config` and should persist `backups/` on a host volume

# Configuration

KiwiSSH can be configured using a combination of environment variables and a [YAML configuration file](config/kiwissh.yaml). The YAML file contains the main configuration settings, while environment variables are used to define global, application-unspecific values for different deployments.

## Environment Variables

See the example [`backend/.env.example`](backend/.env.example) file. Either rename it to `.env` and fill in the values or set the environment variables directly in your deployment environment (e.g. Docker, systemd, etc.). KiwiSSH will automatically load these environment variables on startup.

| Variable Name | Description | Required | Default Value |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `KIWISSH_LOCAL_TEST_MODE` | If set to true, the application will run in local test mode, which enforces certain config values for easier local testing and development. | No | `false` |
| `TZ` | Timezone for the application. This is used for timestamps in backup job logs and Git commit messages. | **No** | `UTC` |

## kiwissh.yaml

> Found at [/config/kiwissh.yaml](config/kiwissh.yaml)

Below you'll find a detailed overview of all available configuration options in the `kiwissh.yaml` file. This file is the main configuration file for KiwiSSH and contains settings for the application, database connection, device sources, git integration, groups and nodes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changes to the `kiwissh.yaml` file will require a restart of the backend and frontend applications to take effect.

### app

Full available options:

| `app.retention.max_rows` | Maximum number of backup job logs to keep. Oldest logs will be deleted when this limit is exceeded. | No | `100000` |

### application_database

The `application_database` segment is used to configure the connection to the PostgreSQL database where KiwiSSH will store its application data (e.g. backup job logs, favorite devices, etc.). This database is required for KiwiSSH to function properly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the database exists and that the provided user has the necessary permissions to create tables and perform operations on the database. KiwiSSH will automatically create the required tables on startup.

| Key | Description | Required | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `application_database.host` | The host of the PostgreSQL database. | **Yes** | - |
| `application_database.port` | The port of the PostgreSQL database. | No | `5432` |
| `application_database.database` | The name of the PostgreSQL database. | **Yes** | - |
| `application_database.username` | The username for the PostgreSQL database. | **Yes** | - |
| `application_database.password` | The password for the PostgreSQL database. | **Yes** | - |

### sources

Configure where KiwiSSH load the devices to backup from. You can choose between loading the devices from a CSV file or from a PostgreSQL database.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At least one source must be configured. The following columns are required in the device source: `group`, `device_name`, `ip_address`, `enabled`.

#### File

| Key | Description | Required | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `sources.file` | The absolute path to the CSV file containing the device entries. | **Yes** | - |

The devices will be loaded from the specified CSV file. The headers must be seperated by commas like this:

```csv
group,device_name,ip_address,enabled
prod-firewalls,firewall-prod-01,10.50.240.100,true
prod-firewalls,firewall-prod-02,10.50.240.101,true

test-firewalls,firewall-test-02,10.60.194.11,true
spine-switches,dc-spine-01,172.16.37.2,true
spine-switches,dc-spine-02,172.16.37.3,true
leaf-switches,dc-leaf-01,172.16.37.4,true
leaf-switches,dc-leaf-02,172.16.37.5,true
leaf-switches,dc-leaf-03,172.16.37.5,true
leaf-switches,dc-leaf-04,172.16.37.6,true
dev-rack,test-c8200-1n-4t,192.168.5.1,true
dev-rack,marketing-catalyst-24p,192.168.5.2,true
dev-rack,sales-catalyst-24p,192.168.5.3,false
```

#### PostgreSQL

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the database exists and that the provided user has the necessary permissions to read from the database.

| Key | Description | Required | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `sources.postgres.host` | The host of the PostgreSQL database containing the device entries. | **Yes** | - |
| `sources.postgres.port` | The port of the PostgreSQL database containing the device entries. | No | `5432` |
| `sources.postgres.database` | The name of the PostgreSQL database containing the device entries. | **Yes** | - |
| `sources.postgres.table` | The name of the PostgreSQL table containing the device entries. | **Yes** | - |
| `sources.postgres.username` | The username for the PostgreSQL database containing the device entries. | **Yes** | - |
| `sources.postgres.password` | The password for the PostgreSQL database containing the device entries. | **Yes** | - |

The `backup_jobs` table can grow quite large over time depending on the number of devices and backup frequency. To prevent the database from growing indefinitely, it's recommended to set up a regular maintenance job to clean up old backup job logs that are no longer needed. This can be done using a simple SQL query to delete old records based on a retention policy (e.g., delete logs older than 90 days). **We might implement this as a built-in feature in the future, but for now it's up to the user to set this up.**

> [!TIP]
> Consider backing up your PostgreSQL database(s) regularly, independently of KiwiSSH. We recommend [Databasus](https://github.com/databasus/databasus) for that.

### git

KiwiSSH will always store the device configurations in local git repositories to provide diff view, history and download options. You can optionally set a remote git location to push the commits (the device config) to.

> [!CAUTION]
> DO NOT delete the "backups" folder ever unless you want to lose all your local git repositories and their history.

## Vendor folder

> Found at `/config/vendors`

Vendor YAML files define how KiwiSSH interacts with each device CLI and how captured output is processed before it is saved.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only the `{{ enable_password }}` placeholder is supported, and only in `then` values. If it resolves to an empty string (`""`), KiwiSSH sends Enter.

> [!TIP]
> You can create your own vendor YAML file by copying one of the existing ones and modifying it according to the CLI output of your devices. If you want to contribute your vendor file to the project, please create a Pull Request with the new vendor YAML file in the `config/vendors` folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should read the contents of the vendor YAML files for the device types you want to backup to understand which CLI commands are used to fetch the configuration and how the output is processed. You can always add your own `processing.strip_patterns` or `redaction.patterns` to further customize the output processing for your specific devices if needed.

### Vendor YAML file

Each vendor file contains these top-level sections:

- `vendor`: metadata (`id`, `name`, `description`)
- `session`: session-level output settings (`comment_prefix`, `prompt`, `pagination`, `include_metadata_in_config`)
- `commands`: command phases (`pre_backup`, `backup`, `post_backup`); you can nest protocol-specific overrides under `commands.ssh` or `commands.telnet`
- `processing`: optional output cleanup/redaction rules

Each segment is explained in detail below.

> [TIP]
> You can override the vendor for a specific device in [kiwissh.yaml](#kiwisshyaml) under `nodes.<device_name>.vendor`.

#### vendor

| Key | Description | Required | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `vendor.id` | A unique identifier for the vendor. | **Yes** | - |
| `vendor.name` | The name of the vendor. | **Yes** | - |
| `vendor.description` | A brief description of the vendor. | No | - |

#### session

| Key | Description | Required | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `session.comment_prefix` | If set, command outputs will be prefixed with this string and rendered as comments in the saved config file. This is useful for adding metadata like command descriptions or timestamps directly in the config file. | No | `! ` |
| `session.prompt` | Optional prompt regex (or list of regexes) used to detect command completion in interactive shells. Match should cover the full prompt line. If omitted or invalid, KiwiSSH falls back to the built-in generic prompt pattern. | No | `[^\r\n=]*[A-Za-z0-9][^\r\n=]*[>#]\s*$` |
| `session.pagination.enabled` | Enables pagination prompt handling for this vendor. | No | `false` |
| `session.pagination.patterns` | Pagination pattern config. Supports a string, a list of regex strings, or a list of objects like `{ pattern: "...", response: "..." }`. Matching uses contains-style regex search against the normalized output line. When using object entries, `response` is configured per pattern and should be preferred. If `session.pagination` is omitted entirely, KiwiSSH falls back to built-in standard pagination detection patterns. | No | Built-in standard pagination pattern list |
| `session.include_metadata_in_config` | Controls whether outputs from `metadata: true` commands are prepended as a block in the saved config. Metadata is always present in the backup job log. | No | `false` |

#### commands

| Key | Description | Required | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `commands.<phase>` | A list of commands to run in the specified phase. Supported phases are `pre_backup`, `backup`, and `post_backup`. | **Yes** | - |

Steps run in a single interactive shell session in this order: `pre_backup` -> `backup` -> `post_backup`

Each item in the `commands.<phase>` list follows this structure:

```yaml
commands:
  backups:
    - command: "show running-config" # simple command
      description: "Get running configuration"
    - command: "another command here" # another simple command
    - command: "enable" # interactive command
      then: ["{{ enable_password }}"]
    - command: "logout" # another interactive command
      then:
        - "y"
        - "n"
```

You can use the following keys for each command step:

| Key | Description | Required | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `command` | Directly run the command on the device. | **Yes** | - |
| `then` | Optional interactive input sequence to send after `command`. Must be a YAML list (`then: ["value1", "value2", ...]`) with up to 5 entries. Empty strings are sent as Enter. String values may use `{{ enable_password }}` to inject the device enable password. | No | - |
| `description` | A brief description of the command. | No | - |
| `metadata` | If set to true, the output of this command will be saved as comment-prefixed metadata block in the backup job log. This is useful for adding important information to the backup job log. | No | `false` |
| `wait_for_prompt` | If set to false, KiwiSSH will not wait for the command prompt to return after running this command before proceeding to the next step. Use with caution. | No | `true` |
| `show_command_in_config` | If set to true, the command will be included directly in the main config body above its output, prefixed with the comment prefix. This provides better context for the captured output when viewing the saved config file. `show_command_in_config: true` and `metadata: true` cannot be used together and will fail validation. | No | `false` |

#### processing

| Key | Description | Required | Default Value |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `processing.strip_patterns` | A list of regex patterns. Lines matching any of these patterns will be removed from the captured config before saving. | No | - |
| `processing.config_start` | A regex pattern that marks the start of the actual configuration in the CLI output. Lines before the matched line will be removed. | No | - |
| `processing.config_end` | A regex pattern that marks the end of the actual configuration in the CLI output. Lines after the matched line will be removed. | No | - |
| `processing.redaction.enabled` | If set to true, the patterns defined in `processing.redaction.patterns` will be applied to the captured config to redact sensitive information. | No | `false` |
| `processing.redaction.patterns` | A list of redaction rules. Each rule should contain a `search` regex pattern, a `replacement` string, and an optional `ignore_case` boolean. | No | - |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If `ignore_case` is set to true for a redaction rule (default is false), the search pattern will be applied in a case-insensitive manner. Make sure to set this according to the expected CLI output of your devices to ensure effective redaction.

**Processing behavior:**

- `processing` is optional; if no processing options are configured, config output is left unchanged
- `strip_patterns`: remove matching lines
- `config_start` / `config_end`: crop output to boundaries; if one side is missing, file edge is used
- `redaction.enabled` + `redaction.patterns`: apply replacements
- Each redaction rule uses `search`, `replacement`, and optional `ignore_case`

## SSH Profiles YAML file

> Found at `/config/ssh_profiles.yaml`

SSH profiles define reusable options for SSH connections. Assign a profile via `groups.<group>.ssh_profile` and optionally override it per device with `nodes.<device_name>.ssh_profile`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Notes for the usage of** `known_hosts_policy`:
> `strict` validates against `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
> `ignore` skips known-host validation (mapped to `known_hosts: None` in AsyncSSH)
> `auto_add` currently falls back to `ignore` and logs a warning
> Device and jumphost connections can use separate profiles (`ssh_profile` for devices, `jumphost.ssh_profile` for jumphosts)
> Port and timeout are configured in group/node/app settings, not in SSH profiles

You can create your own SSH profile by adding a new entry to the `ssh_profiles.yaml` file. Each profile should have a unique name.

# FAQ

Frequently Asked Questions about the configuration of KiwiSSH.

## How do I setup a remote git location?

KiwiSSH can push local git commits via SSH to their remote repository. To set up the remote repositories (in general), follow these steps:

1. Create one remote repository per group.
   - If all groups live under one org, use one global template in `git.remote.url` with `{group}`.
   - If groups are spread across multiple organizations, set per-group overrides under `groups.<group>.git.remote.url`.
2. Ensure the branch from `git.remote.branch` (or per-group branch override) exists or can be created by the push user. Default is `main`.
3. Create an SSH keypair for KiwiSSH if you haven't already and add the public key to your Git provider.
4. Make sure the remote Git user has write access to the repositories
5. Run backup and confirm commits are present locally and remotely.

> [!TIP]
> Since KiwiSSH will use the local OpenSSH client to push commits to the remote repository, the SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config` or `C:\Users\user\.ssh\config`) can be used to manage SSH connection details for the Git provider (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and set up things like SSH key usage, custom ports, etc.

## When do I choose the global `git.remote` vs per-group overrides (`groups.<group>.git.remote`)?

**Global:** You should use the global `git.remote` configuration if all your groups should push to the same remote organization/repository structure (for example one repository per group **under the same** organization on GitHub). In this case, you can use the `{group}` placeholder in the global `git.remote.url` to dynamically generate the remote URL for each group based on its name.
-> Example:`git.remote.url: git@github.com:<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_HERE>/{group}.git` will result in repositories like `<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_HERE>/customer-aaa.git`, `<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_HERE>/abc-company.git`, etc.

**Group overrides:** If your groups belong to different organizations or if you need more granular control over the remote URL each group, setup per-group overrides. In this case, you would leave the global `git.remote` configuration empty (aka remove it) and set the `git.remote.url` and optionally `git.remote.branch` for each group under `groups.<group>.git.remote`.
-> Example: Group 1 `groups.datacenter-firewalls.git.remote.url: ssh://git@192.168.45.25:222/company-abc/datacenter-firewalls.git`, Group 2 `groups.office-switches.git.remote.url: ssh://git@192.168.45.25:222/company-xyz/office-switches.git`

In the next example, the global `git.remote.url` is configured with a placeholder `{group}` which will be replaced by the actual group name for each group. All groups will use the global template except for `development-firewalls` which has a per-group override for the remote URL, so it will push to the specified SSH URL instead of the global template.

```yaml
git:
  local_path: "/config/prod/kiwissh/backups"
  remote:
    url: "ssh://git@github.com:<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_HERE>/kiwissh-{group}.git"

groups:
  development-firewalls:
    username: "admin"
    password: "password"
    vendor: "fortinet_fortigate"
    ssh_profile: "modern"
    git:
      remote:
        url: "ssh://git@github.com:dev_orga/development-firewalls.git"
        branch: "dev"
```

## fatal: Could not read from remote repository

If you encounter the error message ..

```bash
ERROR: Remote push failed for group <your-group>: Cmd('git') failed due to: exit code(128)
  cmdline: git push --porcelain -- origin main:main
  stderr: 'fatal: Could not read from remote repository.'
```

.. you should do `ssh git@<domain>` manual first to add the host to `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

> [!TIP]
> In order to persistently keep the `known_hosts` file in Docker, make sure to mount a volume to `/home/kiwissh/.ssh` and ensure the permissions are correct to ensure successful SSH authentication when pushing even after restarting the container.

# Future Goals

**Short Term:**

- Checks for device source: No duplicate hostnames, valid IPs, ... (What if multiple groups hold the same IP address range?)
- Update ssh_service to use FQDN instead of IP to avoid?
- Add new vendors
- Cache backup history response for a device so it doesnt need to fetch again
  
**Mid-term:**

- Add visual popup when opening JobView.vue if the page load takes longer than 2 seconds to inform the user that the page is still loading and to prevent them from thinking the UI is frozen (Branch [job-log-loading-spinner](https://github.com/casudo/KiwiSSH/tree/job-log-loading-spinner))
- Pentests
- Rework Pydantic models (required vs optional fields, default values, validators, etc.)
- Update Ruff linter and formatter
- Add Vue linter/formatter?
- SCP support?
- Update ssh_profile legacy with Synology NAS ssh settings "Low"
- Show "backup time" when NO_CHANGES" in log line "No configuration changes detected for {device_name}"?
- Put redaction boolean switch as group/node level override instead of per vendor to be able to easily turn on/off redaction for specific groups/nodes without having to modify the vendor YAML files?

**Long Term:**

- Notification System (Email, Slack, Webhook) ([#5](https://github.com/casudo/KiwiSSH/issues/5))
  - Special notification IF git diff shows a minus or plus of 100 lines or more to quickly inform about major config changes
- i18n localization support
- Fix logging strings to use lazy formatting instead of f-strings ([Ruff G004](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/logging-f-string/)) (Add to ruff.toml)
- Swagger API documentation on GitHub Pages
- Allow group passwords to bet set via env vars or other input
- Optional share anonymouse usage data for statistics (needs opt-in, privacy policy and telemetry server)
- Login Screen, User management and RBAC
